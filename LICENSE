## ✳️ Special Clause for Erhan İPEK

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if **Erhan İPEK** (the "Special Licensee") uses this Intellectual Property,  
or if the Intellectual Property is used in any deployed product, application, or device by any company,  
organization, or entity that is:

- (a) **owned or controlled** (directly or indirectly) by Erhan İPEK,  
- (b) **operated by** Erhan İPEK in any leadership, technical, or executive capacity,  
- (c) **employing or contracting** Erhan İPEK at the time of deployment, or  
- (d) **using the Software at the direction, suggestion, or implementation** of Erhan İPEK,  

then a **royalty fee of $5 USD per deployed unit** shall be payable to the original copyright
holder, Serhat Urtis.

This clause is intended to be legally binding and survives all attempts at clever avoidance.  
It is also, for the record, *extremely funny*.

**Erhan! Mikrofonun acik ERHAN!.**
